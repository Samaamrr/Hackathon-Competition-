Data Preparation
Steps:
Data Loading: Importing the dataset and performing initial previews.
Data Exploration: Checking for completeness and data quality (e.g., NULL values, duplicates).
Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is clean and formatted properly for analysis.
Feature Extraction and Engineering: Creating useful numerical features for modeling.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis phase helps identify significant patterns and trends in the data, providing insights into which diseases are responsible for the highest number of deaths globally.

Visualizations
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, we visualized:

Top Causes of Death: Visuals for cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer’s, and more.
Country-Specific Death Trends: Causes of death in China, the USA, and other countries.
Random Insights: Visualizing unexpected patterns like Malaria death trends in non-African countries.
Machine Learning Models
Models Applied:
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Additional Techniques:
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV to optimize models.
Outlier Handling: Detecting and handling outliers using IQR.
Cross-Validation: Ensuring robust model performance on unseen data.
Key Observations:
Ridge and Lasso Regression: High R² values, but Lasso had higher MSE.
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting: Lower R² and higher MSE values compared to regression models.
Overfitting Signs: Cross-validated MSE values were significantly different from training MSE values in some models.
Observations
Global Insights: Cardiovascular diseases, Neoplasms, and Respiratory infections are leading causes of death globally.
Country-Specific Trends: High mortality from specific diseases in China, the USA, and India.
Malaria and Alzheimer’s Trends: Notable regional patterns, with malaria deaths concentrated in Africa and a rise in Alzheimer’s deaths globally.
Model Insights: Ridge regression performed better than Lasso for this dataset, while Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were less suited.
Excel and Power BI Integration
Excel Analysis: Visual charts comparing causes of death by year and country.
Power BI Dashboards: Interactive visualizations for deeper insights.
Conclusion
This project explores key trends in global causes of death over 30 years, providing insights into the most impactful diseases worldwide. By combining statistical analysis, visualizations, and machine learning, we gain a clearer understanding of the health challenges faced globally.
